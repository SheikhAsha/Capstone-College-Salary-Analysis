# Capstone-College-Salary-Analysis

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries

I will be exploring colleges located in United States and the salaries associated with the school type such as State vs Party, 
different majors and where the schools are located. The data set will break down starting, median, 10th, 25th, 75th and 90th
percentile salaries. Some questions we will be exploring is will salaries based on region and school type affect your starting salary.

By the end of our exploration the main hypothesis: Attending an Ivy League school automatically gives you a higher starting salary.
